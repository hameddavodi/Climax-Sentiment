The movie "Climax 2018" directed by Gasper Noe has been the subject of much critical acclaim and debate. To delve deeper into the movie's impact and meaning, we undertook a project to analyze it from three perspectives: text, picture, and music sentiment analysis, using Python programming language. In the text analysis, we examined the screenplay and dialogue for patterns and themes, while the picture analysis focused on cinematography and visual motifs. Lastly, we explored the music in the film, analyzing its emotional impact and how it enhances the viewing experience. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex themes and emotions presented in the film.
