## Intro
The movie "Climax 2018" directed by Gasper Noe has been the subject of much critical acclaim and debate. To delve deeper into the movie's impact and meaning, I undertook a project to analyze it from three perspectives: text, picture, and music sentiment analysis, using Python programming language. In the text analysis, I examined the screenplay and dialogue for patterns and themes, while the picture analysis focused on cinematography and visual motifs. Lastly, I explored the music in the film, analyzing its emotional impact and how it enhances the viewing experience. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex themes and emotions presented in the film.

## Text Data

### 1- Collecting Data

The goal of the code is to extract the subtitles text from a video file in SRT format, perform sentiment analysis on the text using the TextBlob library, and store the sentiment scores for each sentence in a list.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pysrt
from textblob import TextBlob

srt = pysrt.open('vid.srt')

print(srt[5].text)
# Join all the subtitle text into a single string
text = ' '.join(sub.text for sub in srt)  

blob = TextBlob(text)

z=[]
def sensentiment(x):
    for i in x.sentences:
        z.append(i.sentiment)
        
sensentiment(blob)
```
