## Intro
The movie "Climax 2018" directed by Gasper Noe has been the subject of much critical acclaim and debate. To delve deeper into the movie's impact and meaning, I undertook a project to analyze it from three perspectives: text, picture, and music sentiment analysis, using Python programming language. In the text analysis, I examined the screenplay and dialogue for patterns and themes, while the picture analysis focused on cinematography and visual motifs. Lastly, I explored the music in the film, analyzing its emotional impact and how it enhances the viewing experience. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex themes and emotions presented in the film.

P.S note that the text provided here are generated by chatgpt under my confirmation of details and context and analysis. So, basically it helped me to speed up the process of writing. 


## Text Data

### 1- Collecting Data

The code is intended to extract the subtitle text from the SRT file, perform sentiment analysis on the text using TextBlob, and store the sentiment scores for each sentence in a list. Thank you for correcting me.

The reason for this could be that there were no available screenplay files online for the movie being analyzed. Screenplay files are not always publicly available, especially for recent films. On the other hand, SRT subtitle files are commonly available and can be easily extracted from video files or downloaded from online sources.

Since the goal of the code is to perform sentiment analysis on the text of the movie, the SRT subtitle file serves as a suitable alternative to the screenplay file. While the SRT file does not contain the same level of detail as a screenplay file, it still provides a good source of textual content for analysis.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pysrt
from textblob import TextBlob

srt = pysrt.open('vid.srt')

print(srt[5].text)
# Join all the subtitle text into a single string
text = ' '.join(sub.text for sub in srt)  

blob = TextBlob(text)

z=[]
def sensentiment(x):
    for i in x.sentences:
        z.append(i.sentiment)
        
sensentiment(blob)
```
