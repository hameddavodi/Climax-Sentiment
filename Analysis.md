## Intro
The movie "Climax 2018" directed by Gasper Noe has been the subject of much critical acclaim and debate. To delve deeper into the movie's impact and meaning, I undertook a project to analyze it from three perspectives: text, picture, and music sentiment analysis, using Python programming language. In the text analysis, I examined the screenplay and dialogue for patterns and themes, while the picture analysis focused on cinematography and visual motifs. Lastly, I explored the music in the film, analyzing its emotional impact and how it enhances the viewing experience. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex themes and emotions presented in the film.
