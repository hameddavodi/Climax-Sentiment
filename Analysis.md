## Intro
The movie "Climax 2018" directed by Gasper Noe has been the subject of much critical acclaim and debate. To delve deeper into the movie's impact and meaning, I undertook a project to analyze it from three perspectives: text, picture, and music sentiment analysis, using Python programming language. In the text analysis, I examined the screenplay and dialogue for patterns and themes, while the picture analysis focused on cinematography and visual motifs. Lastly, I explored the music in the film, analyzing its emotional impact and how it enhances the viewing experience. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex themes and emotions presented in the film.

P.S note that the text provided here are generated by chatgpt under my confirmation of details and context and analysis. So, basically it helped me to speed up the process of writing. 


## Text Data

### 1- Collecting Data

The code is intended to extract the subtitle text from the SRT file, perform sentiment analysis on the text using TextBlob, and store the sentiment scores for each sentence in a list. Thank you for correcting me.

The reason for this could be that there were no available screenplay files online for the movie being analyzed. Screenplay files are not always publicly available, especially for recent films. On the other hand, SRT subtitle files are commonly available and can be easily extracted from video files or downloaded from online sources.

Since the goal of the code is to perform sentiment analysis on the text of the movie, the SRT subtitle file serves as a suitable alternative to the screenplay file. While the SRT file does not contain the same level of detail as a screenplay file, it still provides a good source of textual content for analysis.



```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pysrt
from textblob import TextBlob

srt = pysrt.open('vid.srt')

print(srt[5].text)
# Join all the subtitle text into a single string
text = ' '.join(sub.text for sub in srt)  

blob = TextBlob(text)

z=[]
def sensentiment(x):
    for i in x.sentences:
        z.append(i.sentiment)
        
sensentiment(blob)
```
### 2- Some quick look into data

next step is to check the data with histograms of polarity and subjectivity.

```python
ax=df_sentiment["polarities"].hist(bins=20, density=True,stacked=False,color='teal', alpha=0.6)
df_sentiment["polarities"].plot(kind='density',color='black')
ax.set(xlabel='polarities')
plt.xlim(-1,1)
plt.show()

ax=df_sentiment["subjectivity"].hist(bins=20, density=True,stacked=False,color='teal', alpha=0.6)
df_sentiment["subjectivity"].plot(kind='density',color='black')
ax.set(xlabel='subjectivity')
plt.xlim(0,1)
plt.show()
```

These lines of code are creating histograms and density plots for the sentiment analysis results of a movie. Specifically, the code is analyzing two sentiment features: polarity and subjectivity.

Polarity and subjectivity are two common measures used in sentiment analysis to quantify the sentiment expressed in a text.

Polarity is a measure of the sentiment expressed in a text, with a range from -1 to 1, where -1 represents a completely negative sentiment, 0 represents a neutral sentiment, and 1 represents a completely positive sentiment. Polarity is calculated by analyzing the words and phrases used in the text to determine if they express a positive or negative sentiment.

Subjectivity, on the other hand, is a measure of the degree to which the text expresses an opinion or personal belief, rather than a fact. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents an objective statement or fact, and 1 represents a highly subjective statement expressing personal opinion or belief. Subjectivity is calculated by analyzing the use of words and phrases that indicate the presence of a personal opinion or belief, such as "I think", "I feel", or "in my opinion".

The fact that the average subjectivity score is near 0 suggests that the majority of the sentences in the movie are expressing objective statements or facts, rather than personal opinions or beliefs. This could indicate that the movie is presenting a narrative that is focused on presenting information or events in a straightforward and objective manner, rather than trying to persuade or influence the audience's emotions or opinions.

The average polarity score being between 0 and 0.25 suggests that the overall sentiment expressed in the movie is slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so. This could indicate that the movie presents a balanced view of the events or themes being explored, rather than being overly biased or extreme in its portrayal. It is worth noting that the average polarity score is only one measure of sentiment, and it is important to look at the distribution of polarity scores across the movie to get a more complete picture of the sentiment expressed.

then:
```python
import nltk
tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)
df_tags=pd.DataFrame(tags,columns=['words','pos'])
df_tags=df_tags.groupby(['pos']).count().sort_values('words', ascending=False)
df_tags=df_tags.head()

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ax = df_t.plot(kind='bar')

# set the title and axis labels
ax.set_title('Word Frequencies')
ax.set_xlabel('Part of Speech')
ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 20))
# display the plot
plt.show()
```
this code performs POS tagging on a list of words, creates a bar chart of the top five most frequent POS tags, and displys it.

PRP stands for personal pronoun, NNP stands for proper noun, NN stands for noun, VBP stands for verb in present tense, and IN stands for preposition/subordinating conjunction.

A high frequency of PRP suggests that the characters in the movie speak using personal pronouns frequently, which may imply that they are expressing their feelings or thoughts more often than they are describing events or objects. Similarly, a high frequency of NNP may suggest that the movie has a significant focus on specific people, places, or things, such as proper names or specific locations. A high frequency of NN suggests that the characters in the movie are talking about objects or things more often than other parts of speech, and a high frequency of VBP suggests that the characters in the movie use present tense verbs frequently.
