## Intro
The movie "Climax 2018" directed by Gasper Noe has been the subject of much critical acclaim and debate. To delve deeper into the movie's impact and meaning, I undertook a project to analyze it from three perspectives: text, picture, and music sentiment analysis, using Python programming language. In the text analysis, I examined the screenplay and dialogue for patterns and themes, while the picture analysis focused on cinematography and visual motifs. Lastly, I explored the music in the film, analyzing its emotional impact and how it enhances the viewing experience. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the complex themes and emotions presented in the film.

Note that the text provided here are generated by chatgpt under my confirmation of details and context and analysis. So, basically it helped me to speed up the process of writing. 


### 1- Collecting Data

The code is intended to extract the subtitle text from the SRT file, perform sentiment analysis on the text using TextBlob, and store the sentiment scores for each sentence in a list. Thank you for correcting me.

The reason for this could be that there were no available screenplay files online for the movie being analyzed. Screenplay files are not always publicly available, especially for recent films. On the other hand, SRT subtitle files are commonly available and can be easily extracted from video files or downloaded from online sources.

Since the goal of the code is to perform sentiment analysis on the text of the movie, the SRT subtitle file serves as a suitable alternative to the screenplay file. While the SRT file does not contain the same level of detail as a screenplay file, it still provides a good source of textual content for analysis.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pysrt
from textblob import TextBlob

srt = pysrt.open('vid.srt')

print(srt[5].text)
# Join all the subtitle text into a single string
text = ' '.join(sub.text for sub in srt)  

blob = TextBlob(text)

z=[]
def sensentiment(x):
    for i in x.sentences:
        z.append(i.sentiment)
        
sensentiment(blob)
```
### 2- Some quick look into data

Next step is to check the data with histograms of polarity and subjectivity.

```python
ax=df_sentiment["polarities"].hist(bins=20, density=True,stacked=False,color='teal', alpha=0.6)
df_sentiment["polarities"].plot(kind='density',color='black')
ax.set(xlabel='polarities')
plt.xlim(-1,1)
plt.show()

ax=df_sentiment["subjectivity"].hist(bins=20, density=True,stacked=False,color='teal', alpha=0.6)
df_sentiment["subjectivity"].plot(kind='density',color='black')
ax.set(xlabel='subjectivity')
plt.xlim(0,1)
plt.show()
```

These lines of code are creating histograms and density plots for the sentiment analysis results of a movie. Specifically, the code is analyzing two sentiment features: polarity and subjectivity.

Polarity and subjectivity are two common measures used in sentiment analysis to quantify the sentiment expressed in a text.

Polarity is a measure of the sentiment expressed in a text, with a range from -1 to 1, where -1 represents a completely negative sentiment, 0 represents a neutral sentiment, and 1 represents a completely positive sentiment. Polarity is calculated by analyzing the words and phrases used in the text to determine if they express a positive or negative sentiment.

Subjectivity, on the other hand, is a measure of the degree to which the text expresses an opinion or personal belief, rather than a fact. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents an objective statement or fact, and 1 represents a highly subjective statement expressing personal opinion or belief. Subjectivity is calculated by analyzing the use of words and phrases that indicate the presence of a personal opinion or belief, such as "I think", "I feel", or "in my opinion".

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233825584-a37c47c5-f837-4529-9282-1328f7df0fd1.png)

The average polarity of a movie's sentences can provide some insight into the overall sentiment expressed in the film. Polarity refers to the degree of positivity or negativity expressed in a statement, with values ranging from -1 to 1. A polarity of 0 indicates a neutral sentiment, while a polarity of 0.25 suggests a slightly positive sentiment.

If a movie has an average polarity of 0, it suggests that the overall sentiment expressed in the film is neutral. This means that the movie does not strongly express positive or negative emotions, but rather presents a balanced perspective. A neutral sentiment can be appropriate for certain genres of movies, such as documentaries or historical dramas, where an objective presentation of facts is necessary.

On the other hand, if a movie has an average polarity of 0.25, it suggests a slightly positive sentiment. This means that the movie contains more positive expressions than negative ones. A slightly positive sentiment can make a movie more enjoyable and uplifting, and may be appropriate for genres such as romantic comedies or feel-good films.

It's important to note, however, that the average polarity of a movie's sentences is just one aspect of the overall sentiment expressed in the film. Other factors, such as the tone of the actors' performances, the musical score, and the overall plot, can also contribute to the emotional impact of a movie.

When the sentences of a movie and the events depicted on screen are opposite to each other, it can create a feeling of cognitive dissonance or emotional conflict in the audience.

Cognitive dissonance occurs when people hold two conflicting beliefs or ideas at the same time. In the context of a movie, if the audience is presented with conflicting information through the dialogue and the events unfolding on screen, it can create a sense of confusion or unease. For example, if a character in a movie expresses love and affection for another character through their dialogue, but their actions and behavior towards that character are cruel and insensitive, it can create a sense of dissonance for the audience.

Emotional conflict can also arise when the sentences of a movie and the events are opposite to each other. This occurs when the audience is presented with conflicting emotional cues. For example, if the dialogue in a movie suggests that a character is feeling happy and content, but the events depicted on screen are tragic and heartbreaking, it can create a sense of emotional turmoil for the audience.

In some cases, the use of opposite sentences and events in a movie can be a deliberate storytelling technique used to create tension, suspense, or to convey a deeper message. However, if not executed properly, it can lead to a disjointed and confusing viewing experience.


![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233825585-cba7f66f-61a2-441d-aa63-dfdc957a84d6.png)

The fact that the average subjectivity score is near 0 suggests that the majority of the sentences in the movie are expressing objective statements or facts, rather than personal opinions or beliefs. This could indicate that the movie is presenting a narrative that is focused on presenting information or events in a straightforward and objective manner, rather than trying to persuade or influence the audience's emotions or opinions.

The average polarity score being between 0 and 0.25 suggests that the overall sentiment expressed in the movie is slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so. This could indicate that the movie presents a balanced view of the events or themes being explored, rather than being overly biased or extreme in its portrayal. It is worth noting that the average polarity score is only one measure of sentiment, and it is important to look at the distribution of polarity scores across the movie to get a more complete picture of the sentiment expressed.

then:
```python
import nltk
tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)
df_tags=pd.DataFrame(tags,columns=['words','pos'])
df_tags=df_tags.groupby(['pos']).count().sort_values('words', ascending=False)
df_tags=df_tags.head()

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ax = df_t.plot(kind='bar')

# set the title and axis labels
ax.set_title('Word Frequencies')
ax.set_xlabel('Part of Speech')
ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 20))
# display the plot
plt.show()
```
this code performs POS tagging on a list of words, creates a bar chart of the top five most frequent POS tags, and displys it.

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233826770-bdbe45ba-6c7e-4f6b-b2a2-0aabe9ca0b35.png)

PRP stands for personal pronoun, NNP stands for proper noun, NN stands for noun, VBP stands for verb in present tense, and IN stands for preposition/subordinating conjunction.

A high frequency of PRP suggests that the characters in the movie speak using personal pronouns frequently, which may imply that they are expressing their feelings or thoughts more often than they are describing events or objects. Similarly, a high frequency of NNP may suggest that the movie has a significant focus on specific people, places, or things, such as proper names or specific locations. A high frequency of NN suggests that the characters in the movie are talking about objects or things more often than other parts of speech, and a high frequency of VBP suggests that the characters in the movie use present tense verbs frequently.

### 3- Word and Sentence Sentiment

The code uses the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library to perform sentiment analysis on words and sentences using the Vader Sentiment Intensity Analyzer.

The first block of code imports the necessary libraries, initializes the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer, and creates empty lists to store the word and sentence sentiments.

The second block of code uses a for loop to iterate over each word in a list of words (w). For each word, the code applies the polarity_scores method of the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to obtain a dictionary of polarity scores (positive, negative, neutral, and compound). This dictionary is then appended to the w_sentiment list.

The third block of code uses another for loop to iterate over each sentence in a list of sentences (s). For each sentence, the code applies the polarity_scores method of the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to obtain a dictionary of polarity scores. This dictionary is then appended to the s_sentiment list.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
w_sentiment=[]
s_sentiment=[]
for word in w:
    w_sentiment.append(analyzer.polarity_scores(word))
    
for sentence in s:
    s_sentiment.append(analyzer.polarity_scores(str(sentence)))
```
The output of this code is two lists (w_sentiment and s_sentiment) containing dictionaries of polarity scores for each word and sentence, respectively. The polarity scores represent the degree of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, as well as an overall compound score that combines all three.

```lua
w_sentiment:
[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0},
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.652, 'pos': 0.348, 'compound': 0.4215},
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.286, 'compound': 0.2732},
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.231, 'compound': 0.2732},
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0},
...

s_sentiment:
[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.734, 'pos': 0.266, 'compound': 0.4404},
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.239, 'compound': 0.4404},
{'neg': 0.13, 'neu': 0.599, 'pos': 0.271, 'compound': 0.4588},
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.34},
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0},
...]
```

These are the output of the VADER sentiment analysis tool, which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media.
The values in the dictionary correspond to:
   - neg: the negative sentiment score (from 0 to 1) of the input text
   - neu: the neutral sentiment score (from 0 to 1) of the input text
   - pos: the positive sentiment score (from 0 to 1) of the input text
   - compound: the overall sentiment score (from -1 to 1) of the input text, calculated by normalizing the scores of neg, neu, and pos and then summing them up.
   
```python
sentence_sentiment=[]
for i in range(len(s_sentiment)):
    sentence_sentiment.append(s_sentiment[i]['compound'])
sns.scatterplot(sentence_sentiment)
```
The code above creates a scatter plot using the Seaborn library in Python. It starts by iterating over a list called s_sentiment and appending the 'compound' value of each dictionary in the list to a new list called sentence_sentiment. The 'compound' value is a sentiment score that ranges between -1 (negative) and +1 (positive), indicating the overall sentiment of a text.

Once sentence_sentiment has been populated, it is passed as the data parameter to the sns.scatterplot() function, which creates a scatter plot with the sentiment score values on the y-axis. The x-axis values are simply the indices of the elements in sentence_sentiment.

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233850896-0684614c-aeb4-4c2a-bdb8-fe49b18fb34c.png)


We may see that the sentiment of the sentences equally distributed. However, lets plot the regression line!!

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
df = pd.DataFrame(s_sentiment)

X = df.index.values.reshape(-1, 1) # use index as predictor variable
y = df['compound'].values 

# create and fit the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# predict the 'compound' values based on the predictor variable
predicted_compound = model.predict(X)

# plot the actual and predicted 'compound' values
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, predicted_compound, color='red')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Compound')
plt.show()
```

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233851011-a84e1a83-9da0-4772-be9d-583c546ce6cc.png)

 Linear regression red line indicates that during the movie, average sentiments of the sentences become more and more negative. 

Also we can be more specific with KMeans and KNeighbors. Here are the steps that the code is performing:

   - Import the necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame object.
   - Extract the predictor variable (time) and the target variable (compound) from the DataFrame.
   - Apply k-means clustering to the target variable to group the data into 3 clusters.
   - Apply KNN regression to predict the 'compound' values for each data point based on the predictor variable.
   - Plot the actual 'compound' values with color-coded cluster labels.
   - Plot the predicted 'compound' values as red dots.
   
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor

# define the predictor and target variables
X = df.index.values.reshape(-1, 1) # use index as predictor variable
y = df['compound'].values # use 'compound' column as target variable

# apply k-means clustering to group the data into 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(y.reshape(-1,1))
cluster_labels = kmeans.predict(y.reshape(-1,1))

# apply KNN regression to predict the 'compound' values for each data point
knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=6)
knn.fit(X, y)
predicted_compound = knn.predict(X)

# plot the actual 'compound' values with color-coded cluster labels
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
scatter = ax.scatter(X, y, c=cluster_labels)
legend = ax.legend(*scatter.legend_elements(),
                    loc="upper right", title="Clusters")
ax.add_artist(legend)
ax.set_xlabel('Time')
ax.set_ylabel('Compound')

# plot the predicted 'compound' values as red dots
plt.plot(X, predicted_compound, color='red')
plt.show()
```
and lets see the results:

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233851168-ec142dbc-9882-4637-b58c-75e05dacdaae.png)

KNN is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm that is often used for regression tasks.
The KNN algorithm works by finding the k closest data points to the query point (in this case, a specific 'time' value), and then taking the average (or weighted average) of the target variable values for those k neighbors. The predicted value for the query point is then set to this average.

To interpret the predicted 'compound' values, you can compare them to the actual 'compound' values plotted in the same figure. If the predicted values closely follow the pattern of the actual values, it suggests that the KNN regression model has successfully captured the underlying relationship between the predictor variable ('time') and the target variable ('compound') in the dataset.

This means that averaged predicted compound sentiments of sentences in the movie fluctuated and touched the extream border points of the nuetral sentiment section. **** I will explain it later. 


What about the word sentiments during the movie?

```python
df_w_sentiment=pd.DataFrame(w_sentiment)
# Resample the data with a window of size 200 and mean aggregation
df_w_sentiment_avg = df_w_sentiment.rolling(window=100).mean()

# Create a stacked bar chart
plt.bar(range(len(df_w_sentiment_avg)), df_w_sentiment_avg['neg'], color='red')

plt.bar(range(len(df_w_sentiment_avg)), df_w_sentiment_avg['pos'], bottom=df_w_sentiment_avg['neg'], color='green')

# Add axis labels and legend
plt.xlabel('Text')
plt.ylabel('Sentiment Score')
plt.legend(['Negative', 'Positive'])

# Display the chart
plt.show()
```
and lets see the result:

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233851799-64744afd-1f03-4182-a2c6-3074345abbf9.png)

I didn't sort the word data, so their order inherently represents the timeline. Therefore, based on the figure above, we can see that although the trend of negative words fluctuated severely alongside the positive words, it still increased over the course of time.

### 4- Color Decomposition !!

Color decomposition with k-means can be used to analyze the sentiment of a movie by identifying the predominant color palette used in the movie frames. This can be a useful metric because colors can evoke different emotions and moods, which can in turn impact the overall sentiment of a movie.

For example, warm colors like red, orange, and yellow can evoke feelings of excitement, passion, and warmth, while cool colors like blue, green, and purple can evoke feelings of calmness, serenity, and sadness. By identifying the predominant colors in a movie, you can gain insights into the emotions and moods that the movie conveys to its audience.

K-means clustering can be used to group similar colors together and identify the most dominant color palettes used in the movie. This can help in identifying the overall sentiment of the movie and can be a useful tool for movie critics and analysts to evaluate and compare movies based on their emotional impact. Using other distance metrics can also help in identifying the similarity of different color palettes and can lead to more accurate clustering and sentiment analysis.

I used cv2 lib to calculate the dominant colors for each frame of the movie and making an average of 3
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd
import os
from tqdm import tqdm
import re
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# function to calculate dominant colors in an image
def calculate_dominant_colors(image, k=3):
    # reshape the image to a 2D array of pixels
    pixels = image.reshape(-1, 3)

    # create a KMeans model and fit it to the pixel data
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(pixels)

    # extract the dominant colors and their counts
    colors, counts = np.unique(kmeans.labels_, return_counts=True)

    # sort the colors by count in descending order
    sorted_colors = colors[np.argsort(-counts)]

    # convert the colors back to 8-bit values
    colors = kmeans.cluster_centers_[sorted_colors].astype(np.uint8)

    return colors

# directory containing the frames
frame_dir = '/*****/Documents/Frames'

# list the files in the directory
frame_files = os.listdir(frame_dir)

# create an empty dataframe to store the results
results_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['frame', 'avg_red', 'avg_green', 'avg_blue'])

# create an empty list to store the results
results_list = []

for frame_file in tqdm(frame_files, leave=True):
    # read the frame from file
    frame_path = os.path.join(frame_dir, frame_file)
    frame = cv2.imread(frame_path)

    if frame is not None:
        # calculate the dominant colors in the frame
        dominant_colors = calculate_dominant_colors(frame)

        # calculate the average dominant color across all colors in the frame
        average_color = np.mean(dominant_colors, axis=0)

        # add the results to the dataframe
        frame_number = int(re.search(r'\d+', os.path.splitext(frame_file)[0]).group())
        results_list.append({'frame': frame_number, 'avg_red': average_color[2], 'avg_green': average_color[1], 'avg_blue': average_color[0]})
    else:
        print(f"Error reading file: {frame_path}")

# create the results DataFrame from the list
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results_list)

# set the 'frame' column as the index
results_df.set_index('frame', inplace=True)

# print the results
print(results_df.head())

```
with the results of: 

```lua
          avg_red  avg_green   avg_blue
frame                                  
136800  35.333333  57.333333  71.666667
83400   57.000000  24.666667  43.666667
87100   73.000000  16.333333   9.666667
109400  24.000000  30.000000  23.666667
106900  71.666667  46.666667  25.666667
```

(This process took almost 37 min with M1 mac !)

```python
results_df=results_df.sort_values('frame')

# Define the RGB values from the dataframe
df = results_df
# Normalize the RGB values between 0 and 1
df_norm = df / 255

# Create a sequence of values from 0 to 1
values = np.linspace(0, 1, len(df))

# Create the colors from the RGB values
colors = [(r, g, b) for r, g, b in zip(df_norm['avg_red'], df_norm['avg_green'], df_norm['avg_blue'])]

# Create a figure and axis object
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Create a colorbar based on the values and colors
colorbar = ax.imshow([colors], aspect='auto', extent=[0, 1480, 0, 1])

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Color Spectrum')
ax.set_xlabel('Frame')
ax.set_ylabel('Color')
ax.set_yticks([])

# Show the colorbar
plt.show()
```
The result is so intresting!

Lets extract the main min and max colors domain!

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# create a list of RGB values
color_list = colors


# create a list of RGB values
# convert the list to a numpy array
X = np.array(color_list)

# specify the number of clusters
n_clusters = 10

# apply KMeans clustering with Manhattan distance metric
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, init='k-means++', max_iter=300, n_init=10,
                algorithm='full').fit(X)

# get the cluster labels
labels = kmeans.labels_

# create an empty dictionary to store the cluster data
cluster_data = {}

# create a figure with subplots for each cluster
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, n_clusters, figsize=(20, 10))

# loop over the clusters and store the color intervals
for i in range(n_clusters):
    cluster_colors = X[labels == i]
    min_color = tuple(np.min(cluster_colors, axis=0))
    max_color = tuple(np.max(cluster_colors, axis=0))
    cluster_data[i] = {'min_color': min_color, 'max_color': max_color}
    min_color = cluster_data[i]['min_color']
    max_color = cluster_data[i]['max_color']
    color_array = np.tile(np.array([min_color, max_color]), (10, 10, 1))
    axs[i].imshow(color_array)
    axs[i].set_xticks([])
    axs[i].set_yticks([])
    axs[i].set_title(f'Cluster {i+1}')

# show the plot
plt.show()
```

The use of color in movies can be a powerful tool for expressing emotions and setting the tone of a scene or the entire movie. Here is a discussion of how dark green, dark brown, gray, and dark red can be used to express different feelings and emotions in a movie:

    Dark green: This color is often associated with nature, growth, and renewal. In a movie, dark green can be used to create a sense of harmony, balance, and vitality. It can also be used to evoke feelings of freshness, youthfulness, and optimism. However, dark green can also be associated with envy and jealousy, so it can be used to express negative emotions such as greed, spite, or distrust.

    Dark brown: This color is often associated with earthiness, stability, and warmth. In a movie, dark brown can be used to create a sense of groundedness, security, and reliability. It can also be used to evoke feelings of comfort, coziness, and hominess. However, dark brown can also be associated with dullness, drabness, and monotony, so it can be used to express negative emotions such as boredom or melancholy.

    Gray: This color is often associated with neutrality, balance, and sophistication. In a movie, gray can be used to create a sense of detachment, objectivity, and impartiality. It can also be used to evoke feelings of elegance, refinement, and understatedness. However, gray can also be associated with bleakness, depression, and conformity, so it can be used to express negative emotions such as sadness or conformity.

    Dark red: This color is often associated with passion, intensity, and danger. In a movie, dark red can be used to create a sense of urgency, excitement, and vitality. It can also be used to evoke feelings of love, desire, and sensuality. However, dark red can also be associated with aggression, violence, and anger, so it can be used to express negative emotions such as rage or danger.
### 5- Soundtrack !!



p.s. I also used librosa to analyse the sound of the movie and I am uploading specific plot to those who are interested of them!


![114](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233867293-48a7581b-6792-4680-b924-553e096a7393.png)
![113](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109058050/233867295-3d8b4dc0-ce78-4377-91ab-8333120737aa.png)

The tempo of music can have a significant emotional impact on listeners. The range of 60 to 120 beats per minute (BPM) is generally considered a moderate tempo and can evoke a range of emotions and moods.

At the lower end of the range (around 60 BPM), the music can feel slow and relaxed. This tempo can evoke feelings of calmness, tranquility, and contemplation. It can be a good choice for music that is meant to be soothing, such as meditation music, relaxation music, or lullabies.

As the tempo increases towards the middle of the range (around 90-100 BPM), the music can start to feel more energetic and upbeat. This tempo can evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, and positivity. It can be a good choice for music that is meant to be uplifting and motivating, such as pop songs, dance music, or workout music.

At the higher end of the range (around 120 BPM), the music can feel fast-paced and intense. This tempo can evoke feelings of urgency, excitement, and even anxiety or tension. It can be a good choice for music that is meant to be energizing, such as rock songs, electronic music, or fast-paced dance music.

Onset strength is a concept used in the field of music psychology to describe the perceived intensity or strength of the beginning of a sound or musical note. It refers to the rate of change in sound pressure level at the onset of a sound.

In terms of emotional expression, onset strength can contribute to the perceived intensity and arousal of a musical piece. Higher onset strength can create a sense of urgency or excitement, while lower onset strength can create a sense of calmness or tranquility.

For example, a piece of music with a high onset strength might begin with a sudden, loud and energetic musical phrase, evoking feelings of excitement or intensity. On the other hand, a piece of music with a lower onset strength might begin with a soft, gradual, and calming musical phrase, evoking feelings of relaxation or peacefulness.

Mel spectrum and uniform tempo prior are two concepts used in music information retrieval and audio analysis.

Mel spectrum refers to a method of representing the frequency content of a sound signal, based on the properties of human auditory perception. The mel scale is a perceptual scale that maps frequency into a more linear and uniform space, reflecting the way in which humans perceive differences in pitch. The mel spectrum is a commonly used representation of audio signals in which the energy in different frequency bands is grouped together according to the mel scale. In terms of emotional expression, the mel spectrum can be used to analyze the spectral properties of music and identify patterns that are associated with particular emotional states or moods.

Uniform tempo prior is a concept used in audio processing to describe the assumption that music typically has a regular, uniform tempo, or beat. This assumption is used to inform the analysis and processing of audio signals, for example, to segment music into sections based on the tempo or to align audio signals to a regular tempo. In terms of emotional expression, uniform tempo prior can be used to analyze the rhythmic properties of music and identify patterns that are associated with particular emotional states or moods, such as the fast and energetic rhythms of music associated with excitement or the slow and smooth rhythms of music associated with calmness.

The high frequency content of music can sometimes extend beyond 4 kHz and even reach up to 8 kHz or higher. The specific range of high frequencies that contribute to the emotional expression of music can vary depending on the musical genre, cultural context, and individual preferences.

In general, high frequency content in music can contribute to the perceived brightness, sharpness, and clarity of musical sounds, which can have an impact on the emotional expression of the music. Music with high frequency content in the middle range (around 2-8 kHz) may be associated with feelings of excitement, energy, and intensity, as well as clarity and sharpness of sound. In contrast, music with lower frequency content and less high frequency content may be associated with feelings of calmness, relaxation, and warmth.

In terms of emotional expression, the combination of high frequency content, mel spectrum, and uniform tempo prior can be used to analyze and identify patterns in the emotional expression of music, including its tempo, rhythm, melody, and harmonic structure. These features can all contribute to the emotional impact of music and help to communicate different emotional states and moods.

In fact, the first article you mentioned, by Juslin and Västfjäll, argues that emotional responses to music are complex and multidimensional, and that they involve various mechanisms such as cognitive appraisal, physiological responses, and cultural factors. The authors suggest that any theory or model of musical emotions must take into account these underlying mechanisms.

Similarly, the second article you mentioned, by Coutinho and Cangelosi, proposes a model to predict subjective feelings of emotion from low-level psychoacoustic features and physiological measurements. However, this model is based on a carefully designed experiment that involved controlled stimuli and a small group of participants.
